Una historia asi muy historica

Dear Acer Support Team,

I am writing this email to express my great disappointment regarding the Acer V5 laptop I recently purchased. Unfortunately, this device has not met my expectations in terms of performance and reliability. Although it was far more expensive than other models I considered, it has turned out to be considerably worse in several key aspects.

The most frustrating problem is the overheating issue. Each time I use the laptop, the temperatures rise much higher than they should, causing frequent shutdowns. Instead of being more stable than my previous computer, it is actually less reliable and significantly more frustrating to use. Even simple tasks such as browsing the internet or writing documents are slower than I had expected from a brand-new device.
